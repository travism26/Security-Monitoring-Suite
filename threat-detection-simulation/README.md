# Threat Detection Simulation

## Design Document

1. Threat Detection Simulation Design Document
   Objective: Create scripts or programs that simulate common security threats to test detection and alerting mechanisms.

Components:

1. Threat Simulation Scripts:

   - Languages: PowerShell, Python
   - Scenarios: - File tampering (e.g., modifying a critical file).
     Unauthorized process launches (e.g., running a suspicious program). - Privilege escalation attempts (e.g., trying to gain admin access).

2. Alerting System:

   - Mechanism: The scripts trigger alerts that are logged or sent to the Windows Monitoring Agent for analysis.
   - Log Integration: Output alerts in a structured log format.

3. Documentation:

   - Step-by-step guide for running simulations.
   - Descriptions of each simulated threat and the expected behavior.

4. Design Considerations:

   - Safety: Ensure that the simulations donâ€™t harm the system.
   - Customizability: Allow users to customize threat parameters.
