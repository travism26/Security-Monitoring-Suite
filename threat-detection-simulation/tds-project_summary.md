# Threat Detection Simulation: Project Summary

## 1. Project Overview

The **Threat Detection Simulation** is a tool designed to simulate real-world security threats by generating synthetic metrics and scenarios that mimic malicious activities. It interacts with the broader system to test the reliability and accuracy of the Log Aggregator, Mini XDR System, and other components. By simulating anomalies and attacks, it ensures that the detection and alerting systems function effectively under various conditions.

## 2. Technical Architecture

### 2.1 Core Stack

- **Language**: Go (Golang) for performance and portability.
- **Integration**:
  - Sends simulated payloads to Kafka topics or directly to the API Gateway.
  - Generates data consistent with the schema used by the System Monitoring Agent.
- **Configuration**:
  - YAML-based configuration for defining simulation scenarios and thresholds.
  - Supports customization of generated metrics (e.g., CPU, memory, network traffic).

### 2.2 Simulation Scenarios

- **High CPU Usage**:
  - Generates synthetic metrics with CPU usage exceeding defined thresholds.
  - Includes metadata tags such as `high_cpu` for easy identification.
- **Memory Anomalies**:
  - Simulates processes with excessive memory usage or memory leaks.
- **Malicious Processes**:
  - Fakes the presence of suspicious processes (e.g., `malware.exe`) with abnormal behavior.
- **Network Activity**:
  - Produces metrics mimicking unauthorized access or data exfiltration.
- **Composite Threats**:
  - Combines multiple scenarios to simulate sophisticated attacks.

## 3. Data Flow Architecture

1. **Payload Generation**:
   - The simulation tool creates synthetic data for various metrics (e.g., CPU, memory, network).
2. **Data Transmission**:
   - Sends generated data to:
     - **API Gateway**: For direct testing of the ingestion pipeline (VIA API GATEWAY).
3. **Processing and Validation**:
   - Consumed by the Api gateway then sends it to the kafka topic and finally read by the Log Aggregator and processed through the rule engine for threat detection.
   - Generates alerts or triggers downstream workflows if anomalies are detected.

## 4. Key Features

- **Configurable Scenarios**:
  - Define simulation parameters (e.g., CPU threshold, process names, severity levels) in a YAML configuration file.
- **Real-Time Simulation**:
  - Generates and transmits data at defined intervals to simulate real-world conditions.
- **Threat Severity**:
  - Assigns severity levels (e.g., LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH, CRITICAL) to simulated anomalies.
- **System Validation**:
  - Verifies the detection and alerting accuracy of the broader system.
- **Interoperability**:
  - Produces data that is STIX-compatible for seamless integration with threat intelligence systems.

- Integrate with existing test suites for automated system validation.

### 5.2 Mid-Term Goals

- Incorporate dynamic feedback loops to adjust simulation scenarios based on system responses.
- Add support for multi-tenant simulation environments to validate enterprise-scale deployments.

### 5.3 Long-Term Vision

- Enable machine learning-driven scenario generation to mimic advanced persistent threats (APTs).
- Build a simulation dashboard to visualize and manage threat simulation campaigns.
- Extend support for external STIX feeds to generate simulated responses to real-world threats.
