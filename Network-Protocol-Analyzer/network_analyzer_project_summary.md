# Network Protocol Analyzer: Project Summary

## 1. Project Overview

The **Network Protocol Analyzer** is a lightweight tool designed to monitor and analyze network traffic on a system. It extracts key packet-level details and provides insights into suspicious or anomalous network behavior. This tool is essential for identifying malicious activity such as unauthorized connections, data exfiltration, or unusual traffic patterns.

## 2. Technical Architecture

### 2.1 Core Stack

- **Language**: Go (Golang) for packet capture and processing
- **Packet Capture Library**: `gopacket` or `pcap` for low-level packet analysis
- **Database**: SQLite or PostgreSQL for storing analyzed network sessions
- **API Style**: RESTful for querying captured traffic and flagged events
- **Visualization**: React or a lightweight dashboard for real-time traffic insights

### 2.2 Core Features

- **Packet Capture**:
  - Capture live network traffic at the packet level (TCP, UDP, ICMP).
  - Filter packets by protocol, source, or destination.
- **Traffic Analysis**:
  - Extract key details (e.g., source IP, destination IP, protocol, data size).
  - Identify patterns such as:
    - Unusual traffic volumes.
    - Connections to known malicious IPs/domains.
- **Anomaly Detection**:
  - Flag traffic based on predefined rules (e.g., high data rates, unknown protocols).
- **Storage**:
  - Store captured packet metadata and flagged anomalies for querying.
- **Alerts**:
  - Generate alerts for suspicious activities (e.g., unauthorized port scans).

## 4. Performance Optimization

### 4.1 Real-Time Capture

- Use multithreading to process packets in parallel.
- Filter packets at the NIC level to reduce processing overhead.

### 4.2 Storage Optimization

- Store metadata only (e.g., headers, not full packet payloads) to reduce database size.
- Archive old network logs for long-term storage.

## 5. Future Roadmap

### 5.1 Short-Term Goals

- Build the core packet capture and analysis pipeline.
- Implement filtering by protocol, source, and destination.

### 5.2 Mid-Term Goals

- Add rule-based anomaly detection for suspicious traffic patterns.
- Integrate with external threat intelligence feeds (e.g., IP reputation databases).

### 5.3 Long-Term Vision

- Build a complete network traffic dashboard with real-time visualizations.
- Extend functionality to support distributed packet capture for enterprise networks.
