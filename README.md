# CyberSecurity-Toolset

A comprehensive suite of security and monitoring tools designed to enhance system performance monitoring, security threat detection, and network analysis capabilities. This repository contains a collection of projects aimed at providing robust security insights and actionable monitoring for various environments, focusing on Windows, macOS systems, and Go-based solutions.

## Project Status: 🚧 Work In Progress

Current Progress:

- 🏗️ [System Monitoring Agent](./system-monitoring-agent/): In development
- 📝 Threat Detection Simulation: Planning phase
- 📝 Log Aggregator: Planning phase
- 📝 Mini XDR System: Planning phase
- 📝 Network Protocol Analyzer: Planning phase

## Project Overview

The CyberSecurity-Toolset repository is being developed as an integrated security suite, with each component designed to work both independently and as part of the larger ecosystem. Each sub-folder represents a unique project with its own README, instructions, and usage guidelines.

## Components:

1. **System Monitoring Agent** (In Development)

   - Lightweight Go agent for real-time system performance monitoring
   - Cross-platform support (Windows, macOS)
   - Kubernetes-ready deployment options

2. **Threat Detection Simulation** (Planning Phase)

   - Simulates common security threats
   - Tests detection mechanisms
   - Integrates with Monitoring Agent data

3. **Log Aggregator with SIEM-Like Features** (Planning Phase)

   - Centralizes logs from multiple sources
   - Implements anomaly detection
   - Provides SIEM-like analysis capabilities

4. **Mini XDR System** (Planning Phase)

   - Correlates events across components
   - Automated incident response
   - Threat intelligence integration

5. **Network Protocol Analyzer** (Planning Phase)

   - Deep packet inspection
   - Traffic pattern analysis
   - Suspicious activity detection

## Development Goals

This project serves as both a practical security toolkit and a learning journey into:

- Windows API integration
- Golang system programming
- Security tool development
- Kubernetes-based deployment architectures
