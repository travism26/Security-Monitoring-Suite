# CyberSecurity-Toolset (Work In Progress)

A comprehensive suite of security and monitoring tools designed to enhance system performance monitoring, security threat detection, and network analysis capabilities. This repository contains a collection of projects aimed at providing robust security insights and actionable monitoring for various environments, focusing on Windows and Go-based solutions.

# Project Overview

The CyberSecurity-Toolset repository includes a range of tools to support system administrators, security analysts, and developers in monitoring and securing systems effectively. Each sub-folder represents a unique project with its own README, instructions, and usage guidelines.

## Current Sub-Projects:

I plan on building the following applications in golang, this will be kind of a side project to learn more about windows security and how to interact with the Windows API.

1. Windows Monitoring Agent: A lightweight Windows agent built in Go for real-time monitoring of system performance.
2. Threat Detection Simulation: Simulates common security threats to test detection mechanisms.
3. Log Aggregator with SIEM-Like Features: Aggregates and analyzes logs from multiple sources for anomaly detection.
4. Mini XDR System: Correlates events from various sources to detect and respond to security incidents.
5. Network Protocol Analyzer: Monitors and analyzes network traffic to detect suspicious activities.
