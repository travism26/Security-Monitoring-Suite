# Operator for Security Monitoring System: Project Summary (Lowest priority do not implement)

## 1. Project Overview

The **Security Monitoring System Operator** is a Kubernetes-native application designed to automate the deployment, scaling, and management of the components in the Security Monitoring ecosystem. This operator encapsulates the operational knowledge for managing services like the Log Aggregator, Mini XDR System, Kafka, PostgreSQL, and Threat Detection Simulation into a single, declarative interface.

By leveraging Kubernetes' native capabilities and custom resources (CRDs), the operator simplifies application lifecycle management, ensuring high availability, scalability, and consistency across environments.

## 2. Technical Architecture

### 2.1 Operator Framework

- **Framework**: Operator SDK (Go-based)
- **Language**: Go (Golang)
- **Core Kubernetes Concepts**:
  - **Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs)**: Define the desired state of system components.
  - **Controller**: Reconcile the current state with the desired state.
  - **Reconciliation Loop**:
    - Observe the current state of resources.
    - Compare it with the desired state (from the CRDs).
    - Apply necessary actions to bring the system to the desired state.

### 2.2 Managed Components

- **Log Aggregator**:
  - Deploys and manages Kafka consumers and PostgreSQL.
  - Ensures proper ingestion and processing of logs.
- **Mini XDR System**:
  - Manages event correlation, STIX integration, and response workflows.
- **Threat Detection Simulation**:
  - Automates the lifecycle of simulated threat scenarios.
- **Kafka**:
  - Provisions Kafka brokers, topics, and consumer groups.
- **PostgreSQL**:
  - Creates and configures database instances for logs and alerts.

### 2.3 Features

- **Lifecycle Management**:
  - Automate deployments, updates, and restarts.
- **Self-Healing**:
  - Monitor health of components and restart failed pods or services.
- **Dynamic Scaling**:
  - Scale components like Kafka consumers or Log Aggregator pods based on workload.
- **Configuration Updates**:
  - Dynamically apply configuration changes through updates to CRD instances.
- **Multi-Tenancy**:
  - Support multiple instances of the system for different tenants.

## 4. Reconciliation Logic

### 4.1 High-Level Reconciliation Flow

1. Observe Current State:
   - Fetch existing Kubernetes resources (e.g., Deployments, Services) managed by the operator.
2. Compare Desired and Current States:
   - Compare resource configurations against the CRD specification.
3. Apply Changes:
   - Create, update, or delete Kubernetes resources to match the desired state.
4. Monitor and Heal:
   - Continuously monitor resource health and take corrective actions as needed.

### 4.2 Example Reconciliation Logic (Log Aggregator)

1. Check if the Kafka topics specified in the LogAggregator CRD exist:
   - If not, create them using the Kafka Admin API.
2. Ensure the PostgreSQL database connection is active:
   - If not, attempt to reconnect or redeploy the database pod.
3. Verify the Log Aggregator deployment:
   - If replicas are not matching the desired count, scale the deployment.
4. Update configuration maps or environment variables if CRD changes.
