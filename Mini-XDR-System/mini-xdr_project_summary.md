# Mini XDR System: Project Summary

## 1. Project Overview

The **Mini XDR System** (Extended Detection and Response) is a lightweight, extensible system designed to correlate and analyze security events from multiple sources (e.g., logs, metrics, network activity). It provides centralized event management, anomaly detection, and response capabilities, enabling proactive threat identification and mitigation.

## 2. Technical Architecture

### 2.1 Backend Stack

- **Language/Framework**: Go (Golang) for core event processing and analysis
- **Message Broker**: Kafka for event ingestion and correlation
- **Database**: PostgreSQL or Elasticsearch for event storage
- **API Style**: RESTful for querying and managing events
- **Authentication**: JSON Web Tokens (JWT) or OAuth2 for secured APIs
- **Testing**: Go's testing suite with mock Kafka streams

### 2.2 Core Features

- **Event Correlation**: Aggregate and relate events across multiple sources (system metrics, application logs, network activity).
- **Response Actions**:
  - Trigger external workflows (e.g., blocking IPs via firewalls).
  - Notify response teams through email or Slack integrations.
- **Severity Scoring**: Assign risk levels (LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH, CRITICAL) based on event context and predefined rules.
- **Threat Intelligence**:
  - Leverage third-party APIs or feeds (e.g., VirusTotal, ThreatConnect).
  - Enrich events with additional metadata for deeper analysis.

### 2.3 Data Pipeline

- **Data Sources**:
  - System metrics and logs from Kafka topics.
  - Network data from a Network Protocol Analyzer.
  - External threat intelligence feeds.
- **Processing**:
  - Normalize incoming data into a unified format.
  - Apply detection rules or machine learning models for anomaly detection.
- **Storage**:
  - Persist correlated events and alerts in a centralized database.

### 2.4 Visualization and Alerts

- Provide a dashboard for viewing:
  - Security events and their correlations.
  - Severity-based trends over time.
  - Triggered response actions.
- **Alert Notifications**:
  - Integrate with email, Slack, or PagerDuty for critical alerts.

## 4. Future Roadmap

### 4.1 Short-Term Goals

- Build the event correlation engine with rule-based detection.
- Integrate basic response actions (e.g., notifications).

### 4.2 Mid-Term Goals

- Expand data sources to include more metrics and network data.
- Implement ML-based anomaly detection for smarter analysis.

### 4.3 Long-Term Vision

- Evolve into a comprehensive XDR system with automated response capabilities.
- Add support for multi-tenant environments for enterprise use.
