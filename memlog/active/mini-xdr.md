## Notes
- All components should implement proper error handling and logging
- Security testing should be integrated from the start
- Regular security audits should be scheduled
- Documentation should be maintained alongside development
- All new features should follow the project's coding standards
- Integration tests should be written for all components
- Performance benchmarks should be established early
# SIEM Dashboard Tasks
## Build and Deployment Issues [Priority: High]

## Recent Updates (Last 2 weeks)

[2025-02-27]
- Identified issue with SIEM dashboard failing to start in production mode
- Error occurs when trying to run 'npm start' without first building the application
- Solution is to run 'next build' before 'npm start'
- Fixed import errors in dashboard/page.tsx:
  - Changed AlertComponent import to use Alert from '../components/Alert'
  - Fixed SystemHealth import to use direct path '../components/SystemHealth/SystemHealth'
  - Updated component references in JSX to match imported names
- Successfully built and started the SIEM dashboard in production mode

## Event Emitter Memory Leak Warning [Priority: Medium]
--
[2025-02-27]
- Identified issue with MaxListenersExceededWarning in the SIEM dashboard
- Warning occurs due to multiple components using polling intervals (useSystemMetrics, useEventLog, useAlerts, useNetworkTraffic, useSystemHealth)
- Each component creates HTTP requests that add 'close' event listeners to the server
- The default max listeners limit is 10, but we have 11 listeners being added
- Created utils/eventEmitterConfig.ts to increase the default max listeners limit to 20
- Added import to app/layout.tsx to ensure the configuration is loaded early in the application lifecycle
- Added utility functions to get and set max listeners count for future flexibility

## Next Steps

1. Implement event enrichment system
2. Create event correlation engine
3. Add event prioritization logic
4. Implement event deduplication

- [x] Add alert management endpoints
- [x] Create trend analysis endpoints
- [x] Add authentication middleware
- [x] Implement rate limiting
- [x] Add API documentation (Swagger/OpenAPI)
