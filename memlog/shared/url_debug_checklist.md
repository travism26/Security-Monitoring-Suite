## Testing Status

### Development Environment

- Base URL: http://localhost:8080
- Authentication: Not implemented
- Rate Limiting: Not implemented

### Testing Notes

1. All endpoints need authentication once implemented
2. Rate limiting to be added for production
3. Response caching to be implemented
4. API versioning through URL prefix
5. Standardized error responses needed

### Common Response Codes

- 200: Successful operation
- 201: Resource created
- 400: Bad request
- 401: Unauthorized
- 403: Forbidden
- 404: Resource not found
- 429: Too many requests
- 500: Internal server error

### Response Headers

- Content-Type: application/json
- Authorization: Bearer token
- X-Request-ID: Request tracking
- X-Rate-Limit-Remaining: Rate limit info

## Debug Tools

- [ ] Implement request logging
- [ ] Add response time monitoring
- [ ] Set up API documentation
- [ ] Create integration tests
- [ ] Add performance benchmarks

## Known Issues

1. No rate limiting implementation
2. Missing authentication
3. Basic error handling only
4. Limited validation on request parameters

## Next Steps

1. Implement authentication system
2. Add request validation
3. Set up rate limiting
4. Create API documentation
5. Add monitoring and logging
