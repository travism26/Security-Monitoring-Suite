# SIEM Dashboard Tasks

## Build and Deployment Issues [Priority: High]
Status: Completed
- [x] Identify Next.js build issue
  - Error: Could not find a production build in the '.next' directory
  - Root cause: Attempting to run production server without building first
  - Solution: Run 'next build' before 'next start'
- [x] Document proper build and deployment process
- [ ] Add build step to deployment scripts

[2025-02-27]
- Identified issue with SIEM dashboard failing to start in production mode
- Error occurs when trying to run 'npm start' without first building the application
- Solution is to run 'next build' before 'npm start'
- Fixed import errors in dashboard/page.tsx:
  - Changed AlertComponent import to use Alert from '../components/Alert'
  - Fixed SystemHealth import to use direct path '../components/SystemHealth/SystemHealth'
  - Updated component references in JSX to match imported names
- Successfully built and started the SIEM dashboard in production mode

## Event Emitter Memory Leak Warning [Priority: Medium]
Status: Completed
- [x] Identify source of MaxListenersExceededWarning
  - Error: MaxListenersExceededWarning: Possible EventEmitter memory leak detected. 11 close listeners added to [Server]. MaxListeners is 10.
  - Root cause: Multiple components with polling intervals creating HTTP requests without proper cleanup
  - Solution: Increase the default max listeners limit and optimize polling strategies
- [x] Implement fix for MaxListenersExceededWarning
  - Created utils/eventEmitterConfig.ts to increase the default max listeners limit
  - Added import to app/layout.tsx to ensure early loading
  - Increased limit from 10 to 20 to accommodate future components

[2025-02-27]
- Identified issue with MaxListenersExceededWarning in the SIEM dashboard
- Warning occurs due to multiple components using polling intervals (useSystemMetrics, useEventLog, useAlerts, useNetworkTraffic, useSystemHealth)
- Each component creates HTTP requests that add 'close' event listeners to the server
- The default max listeners limit is 10, but we have 11 listeners being added
- Created utils/eventEmitterConfig.ts to increase the default max listeners limit to 20
- Added import to app/layout.tsx to ensure the configuration is loaded early in the application lifecycle
- Added utility functions to get and set max listeners count for future flexibility

## Process Termination Hanging Issue [Priority: High]
Status: Completed
- [x] Identify source of Ctrl+C hanging issue
  - Issue: Application hangs when trying to terminate with Ctrl+C
  - Root cause: Multiple polling intervals and event listeners not being properly cleaned up during termination
  - Solution: Implement proper signal handlers to ensure all resources are cleaned up on termination
- [x] Implement fix for Ctrl+C hanging issue
  - Created utils/signalHandlers.ts to handle termination signals (SIGINT, SIGTERM)
  - Added cleanup logic to reset EventEmitter max listeners and force garbage collection
  - Added handlers for uncaught exceptions and unhandled promise rejections
  - Imported signal handlers in app/layout.tsx to ensure early registration

[2025-02-27]
- Identified issue with SIEM dashboard hanging when terminated with Ctrl+C
- Issue started after migrating to hooks + component architecture
- Root cause is multiple hooks (useSystemMetrics, useNetworkTraffic, useEventLog, useAlerts, useSystemHealth) setting up polling intervals
- While each hook has cleanup functions for component unmounting, these aren't properly executed during abrupt termination
- Created utils/signalHandlers.ts with proper handlers for SIGINT (Ctrl+C) and SIGTERM signals
- Implemented cleanup logic to reset EventEmitter max listeners and force garbage collection
- Added handlers for uncaught exceptions and unhandled promise rejections to ensure graceful shutdown
- Imported signal handlers in app/layout.tsx to ensure they're registered early in the application lifecycle
