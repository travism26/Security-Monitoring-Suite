# System Monitoring Agent

A cross-platform system monitoring agent built in Go that collects and logs detailed system metrics. Currently supports macOS and Windows.

## Features

- Real-time system metrics collection:
  - CPU usage
  - Memory usage (used, total, percentage)
  - Disk statistics (total, used, free, usage percentage)
  - Network statistics (bytes sent/received, transfer rates)
- JSON-formatted logging for easy integration with log analyzers (Splunk, ELK Stack)
- Configurable monitoring intervals
- Cross-platform support (macOS, Windows)

# Design Ideas

## Architecture

This is a high-level architecture diagram of the system monitoring agent.

Monitoring Agent is a lightweight, cross-platform application that collects system metrics and logs them to a file. I will be deploying all my other applications on Kubernetes, so I want to keep this lightweight and easy to deploy.

```

## Prerequisites

- Go 1.22 or higher
- Access to system metrics (may require elevated privileges)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/system-monitoring-agent.git
cd system-monitoring-agent
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
go mod download
```

## Configuration

The agent can be configured through `configs/config.yaml`:

```yaml
LogFilePath: "./agent.log"
Interval: 10 # Polling interval in seconds
Monitors:
  CPU: true
  Memory: true
  Disk: true
  Network: true
```

## Building

```bash
go build -o monitoring-agent ./cmd/agent/main.go
```

## Running

```bash
./monitoring-agent
```
